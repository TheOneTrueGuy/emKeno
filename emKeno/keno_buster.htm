<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keno Buster is an
advanced neural net program designed to discern patterns in keno sequences and
any other computer generated random numbers. Keno Buster runs on most pocket pc
type handheld PDAs.</p>

<p align="center">Keno buster has a simple 10 key pad for entering numbers which
appear in the top cells. When all 20 numbers have been entered there are three
different methods for detecting patterns, depending on how you want to do it.
Scan is the fastest, simplest method. It doesn't require that numbers be entered
in any particular order. In Order is the most accurate method but it requires
that numbers be entered as they come out of the keno generator (before they've
been sorted.) this method is easiest if you have someone to tell you the
numbers. If you're alone and slow like me, you can use Sorted to look for
patterns after the keno numbers have been sorted from small to large. It's less acute
at picking out patterns but still gains a 12% advantage.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A note about KenoBuster's operation:
KenoBuster is a probabilistically driven neural net. It won't instantly make you
a winner, but it will improve your odds. Thus, using it persistently and
successively is the secret to making it work. The odds improvement isn't great
with Scan or Sorted (about 12~18%) it doesn't so much increase your winnings as
decrees your rate of loss. If you use it every time you'd normally gamble on
keno you'll get back more of the money you'd normally lose. What that means is
you get more chances of hitting the big one for less money than you'd normally
spend.</p>
